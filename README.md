# Graph

The application draws the graph of a mathematical function given by the user. It was made in C++ using the SFML API for drawing, on Windows.

# Installation

For compilation I used SFML 2.5.1. You must link the library if you want to recompile the project( more on how you can do it [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)).

# Usage

When you run the exe the code, you will be asked to prove a function to be drawn. For the moment the application supports the following mathematical functions:

* Polynomials
* Natural Logarithm
* Sine
* Cosine

Any combination between them is welcomed as well
